## Project idea
Regina Community fridge has a great way to provide meals to people who need in Regina. There is a need for such a system in Elementary schools where there are no cafeterias.Restaurants can package leftover foods, to have it be picked up by a volunteer and then distributed to schools in their area
Restaurants can further come together and provide some free pre-packaged lunches that can be delivered to schools in their area and stored for kids to access during breaks.

      
## Project background/Business Opportunity
According to the World Food Programme, 135 million suffer from acute hunger largely due to man-made conflicts, climate change and economic downturns. The COVID-19 pandemic could now double that number, putting an additional 130 million people at risk of suffering acute hunger by the end of 2020.With more than a quarter of a billion people potentially at the brink of starvation, swift action needs to be taken to provide food and humanitarian relief to the most at-risk regions.

I believe there is an opportunity for communities to step up and help those in need in a way that is simple and easy. Since we see a lot of food everyday go to waste from restaurants, or people unsure of what they can and cannot donate, this application intends to help restaurants and surrounding members of the community provide meals for school kids in need to reduce waste. In Regina, there is a lack of facilities for underprivileged school kids to access free meals at school. Although there are some small programs that try to help provide for such kids, I believe there is an opportunity for restaurants to donate food that would otherwise be thrown out, and instead contributing it to schools in their community.
