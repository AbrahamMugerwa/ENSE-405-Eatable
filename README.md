## Project idea
Community fridge has a great way to provide meals to people who need in Regina, SK
There could be some improvement to afford people a way to know what to donate, including:
  <li> What is acceptable and not acceptable </li>
			<li> What they have in stock and what they need </li>
			<li> Expiration dates to easily track items </li>
		  <li> Allow inputting of donars items to update the system </li>
			<li> Allow for single stream to keep track of volunteering </li>
			<li> Allow some sort of chat capability for organizers to provide quick updates and donars to provide feedback </li>
      
## Project background/Business Opportunity
According to the World Food Programme, 135 million suffer from acute hunger largely due to man-made conflicts, climate change and economic downturns. The COVID-19 pandemic could now double that number, putting an additional 130 million people at risk of suffering acute hunger by the end of 2020.With more than a quarter of a billion people potentially at the brink of starvation, swift action needs to be taken to provide food and humanitarian relief to the most at-risk regions.

I believe there is an opportunity for communities to step up and help those in need in a way that is simple and easy. Since we see a lot of food everyday go to waste, or people unsure of what they can and cannot donate, this application can help educate, and remove the barriers to entry that will result in helping a lot of underprivileged people within our communities.
